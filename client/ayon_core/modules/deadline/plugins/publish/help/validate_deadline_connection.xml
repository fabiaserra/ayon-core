## Deadline authentication is required

This project has set in Settings that Deadline requires authentication.

### How to repair?

Please go to Ayon Server > Site Settings and provide your Deadline username and password.
In some cases the password may be empty if Deadline is configured to allow that. Ask your administrator.

<description>## Shapes mismatch IDs with original shape

Meshes are detected where the (deformed) mesh has a different `cbId` than
the same mesh in its deformation history.
These should normally be the same.

### How to repair?

By using the repair action the IDs from the shape in history will be
copied to the deformed shape. For **animation** instances using the
repair action is usually the correct fix.

### How does this happen?

When a deformer is applied in the scene on a referenced mesh that had no
deformers then Maya will create a new shape node for the mesh that
does not have the original id. Then on scene save new ids get created for the
meshes lacking a `cbId` and thus the mesh then has a different `cbId` than
the mesh in the deformation history.

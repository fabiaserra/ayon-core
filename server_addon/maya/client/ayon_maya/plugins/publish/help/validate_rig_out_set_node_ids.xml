<description>## Shapes mismatch IDs with original shape

Meshes are detected in the **rig** where the (deformed) mesh has a different
`cbId` than the same mesh in its deformation history.
These should normally be the same.

### How to repair?

By using the repair action the IDs from the shape in history will be
copied to the deformed shape. For rig instances, in many cases the
correct fix is to use the repair action **unless** you explicitly tried
to update the `cbId` values on the meshes - in that case you actually want
to do to the reverse and copy the IDs from the deformed mesh to the history
mesh instead.

### How does this happen?

When a deformer is applied in the scene on a referenced mesh that had no
deformers then Maya will create a new shape node for the mesh that
does not have the original id. Then on scene save new ids get created for the
meshes lacking a `cbId` and thus the mesh then has a different `cbId` than
the mesh in the deformation history.

<description>## Non-Manifold Edges/Vertices

Meshes found with non-manifold edges or vertices.

### How to repair?

Run select invalid to select the invalid components.

You can also try the _cleanup matching polygons_ action which will perform a
cleanup like Maya's `Mesh > Cleanup...` modeling tool.

It is recommended to always select the invalid to see where the issue is
because if you run any repair on it you will need to double check the topology
is still like you wanted.

### What is non-manifold topology?

_Non-manifold topology_ polygons have a configuration that cannot be unfolded
into a continuous flat piece, for example:

- Three or more faces share an edge
- Two or more faces share a single vertex but no edge.
- Adjacent faces have opposite normals

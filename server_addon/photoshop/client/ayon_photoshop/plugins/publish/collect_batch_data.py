"""Parses batch context from json and continues in publish process.

Provides:
    context -> Loaded batch file.

Code is practically copy of `openype/hosts/webpublish/collect_batch_data` as
webpublisher should be eventually ejected as an addon, eg. mentioned plugin
shouldn't be pushed into general publish plugins.
